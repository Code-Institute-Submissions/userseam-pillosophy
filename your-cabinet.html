<p>Bromhexine is a mucolytic drug used in the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with viscid or excessive mucus.  It was originally derived as an extract derivative called vasicinone from the Indian plant, Adhatoda vasica.

    Bromhexine is intended to support the body's mechanisms for clearing mucus from the respiratory tract.

    <p>Ibuprofen is a medication that is used for treating pain, fever, and inflammation as well as painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. Ibuprofen is derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics. propionic acid and its initial development were in 1960 while researching a safer alternative for aspirin.
    Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding.
    Ibuprofen combined with paracetamol is considered generally safe in children for short-term

            Substances that act as inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme such as grape juice should never be consumed in combination with this medication. Grapefruit juice can block the action of intestinal CYP3A4, so instead of being metabolized, more of the drug enters the blood and stays in the body longer. The result: too much drug in your body.

            <p>Mometasone, also known as mometasone furoate, is a steroid medication used to treat certain skin conditions and asthma.
               
                Specifically, it is used to prevent rather than treat asthma attacks and is applied to the skin, inhaled, or used in the nose.
                Mometasone furoate was patented in 1981 and came into medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.
                Although mometasone furoate does not have significant systemic immunomodulatory effects, it can be considered a local immunosuppressive drug because clinical studies have shown reductions (vs. baseline ) in neutrophils (a white blood cell) in the nasal mucosa. common side effects are :

                    <p>Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medication used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain.

                        At a standard dose, paracetamol only slightly decreases body temperature, it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect, and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear.
                        Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Common side effects of this medication are :
